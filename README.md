A smart assistant that reads your documents so you don't have to.

*How It Works (RAG Architecture)
 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines search + generation.

Step-by-step flow:

- Extract text from the uploaded file using file-specific parsers.
- Chunk the text into small pieces using Langchain's splitter
- Embed each chunk into a high-dimensional vector using Geminiâ€™s embedding model.
- Store embeddings into ChromaDB, a vector database.
- Query: When a user asks something, the query is also embedded.
- Retrieve top-k similar chunks from ChromaDB.
- Generate: Gemini takes the retrieved chunks + the question â†’ generates a grounded answer.
